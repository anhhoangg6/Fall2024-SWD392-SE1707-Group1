          <p>
        We understand how crucial it is to maintain the well-being of koi fish during transit. Thatâ€™s why we take extra precautions to ensure that each fish is carefully handled from the moment it leaves our facility to its arrival at your home. Our koi are transported in oxygenated, temperature-controlled environments to minimize stress and ensure their safety. Upon arrival, we provide you with easy-to-follow guidelines on how to acclimate your koi to their new pond, ensuring they thrive in their new surroundings with minimal stress.
